#export BORG_REPO=ssh://username@example.com:2022/~/backup/main
export BORG_REPO=ssh://example-org/~/borg-$HOSTNAME

# Setting this, so you won't be asked for your repository passphrase:
export BORG_PASSPHRASE='foo bar baz qux'
# or this to ask an external program to supply the passphrase:
#export BORG_PASSCOMMAND='pass show backup'

# Remote borg path. On rsync.net, this should be "borg1".
