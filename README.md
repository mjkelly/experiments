_The canonical location of this repo is:
<https://git.sr.ht/~mkelly/experiments>. Other locations are mirrors._

Monorepo of experiments that are too small or short-lived to put in their own
repositories. If I go further projects here, I split them off into their own
repos.

Documentation is very sparse, but my goal is for everything to be in a working
state when it is committed. Some sub-directories have their own README files
with more info.

In case anyone wants to use any of this, there is a general license in the
LICENSE file. Some individual files list their own license (in a subirectory,
or at the top of the file) which supercedes the general LICENSE file.
